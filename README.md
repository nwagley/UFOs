# UFOs
## Overview 
The purpose of this assignement is to provide in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. 
In additional to the date, you'll add table filters for the city, state, country and shape. 

## Website Details
The Website has a description when you start looking at it from the top of the page, and it gives you a detailed analysis of this introduction of the 
topic. The topic in this case is UFO sightings. When we look  at little further down there is a table, in this table the information is devided into 
date of the sighting, city where the sighting occured, state, country, how long it took place and discription. To the right of the table there are 
comments or description. The left most part of the website and beside the table where is a search criteria box, where you can filter your search and 
get filtered data depending on which city you want the information from. 

## Summary 
All in all this website is easy to use and filter data when someone needs any information about UFO sightings. One of the drawback of this new design 
can be seen as being a little simple on the way its assorted, the table data, filter table and search bar could use more updates if being compared to 
newer websites. Two recommendations I would say would be, if we could add a picture in each of the sitings and have the picture pop up on the top left
side of the site when the user filters it, that would look nice also, we can also put an interactive google map on the bottom to for users to visualize
the sightings and maybe see a pattern that maybe some of us have missed.
